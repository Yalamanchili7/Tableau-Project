# Tableau-Project
Planning (Phase I):
Objective: To build a dataset that would allow the creation of various recommender systems and perform sentiment analysis on movies.
Data: Utilizes the IMDb Open API to gather metadata on films, focusing on aspects such as length, language, producer, country, IMDB rating, and more.
Decision Making (Phase II):
Tools and Techniques: The decision to use Tableau for visualizations is based on its user-friendly interface and robust capabilities. This phase also involves data preparation and preprocessing to refine the dataset by removing redundant columns using SQL.
Questions and Visuals: You've listed specific questions like the most favored film genre by audiences, the highest-rated film in each genre, and the relationship between a film's budget and its commercial success, among others. Various plots are planned to address these questions, such as pie charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and more.
Dashboard Implementation (Phase III):
Dashboard Overview: A comprehensive dashboard is developed to visualize data related to film performance, popularity, and trends. This includes visualizations like bubble charts, bar charts, and timelines to analyze aspects like social media impact on movie ratings, film budget vs. financial success, and content rating changes over the years.
Interactivity: Features such as calculated parameters, reference lines, and filters are implemented to enhance the dashboard's utility and user engagement. For example, users can select specific genres to filter data, making the visualizations more relevant and tailored.
